# üì¢ Announcements
## üî• Work in progress
**This project is still in development**, some circuit diagrams, source codes or part list may **change** in upcoming days, either some things may **not work** yet. <br />
It's **not recommended** to create **your own DIY** project heavily **based on** this project **yet**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Now **working** on: 
* Construction of the accumulator: *BMS wasn't working as expected, so after complaint next one will come soon; working on 3D model to hide all parts into*
* Bicycle frame filling: *parts ready, no time at all, I'll work on it soon*
* Rear bicycle fender frame: *parts ready, no time at all, I'll work on it soon*
* Electronics testing: *almost everything except reed switches tested*
* Code testing: *no time at all, I'll work on it soon*

# üìö Informations
## What is it?
**DIY** project, called **CyberBicycle**, is a project that I created to learn and **have fun**. It is bicycle **add-on** containing electronics, sensors, LEDs, microcontrolers and other stuff.
## What it consists of?
There are **3** main parts:
* **Electronics** and all circuits,
* **Accumulator**,
* **Bicycle "upgrades"**.
## Where can I find all the informations?
In the **[pdf file](https://github.com/Bajojajo-xD/CyberBicycle/blob/main/Circuit-LEDs-bicycle-docs.pdf)** you can find current **components list**, pre-drawn **circuits** and even **more**.
